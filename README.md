## Dot files for my arch+i3 setup

to install, just...
```
chezmoi init --apply $GITHUB_USERNAME
```
in case I'll be using a private repo for some reason, run this instead...
```
chezmoi init --apply git@github.com:$GITHUB_USERNAME/dotfiles.git
```

### What I have yet To do/backup:
- [ ] setup nvim as IDE & backup it!!!
- [ ] setup a notification service
- [ ] write instructions for a new, fresh arch install (w/ necessary list of packages + i3)
- [ ] bash/zsh customization & backup (maybe time between commands only, not autocomplete and syntax)
